# Dice-Roll-Empirical-vs-Theoretical-Probability
This program simulates up to 100,000 dice rolls to get the empirical probability of rolling all 6 dice the same number with only 1 reroll. Empirical probability is compared directly to theoretical probability. Pseudo random number generation used. 

No input required. 
Sample Output:
This program calculates the probability of rolling the same number on 5 standard 6-sided dice
The program runs this experiment 100 times for a total of 1 million rolls and returns the average
probability across each 100,000 iterations of dice rolls and calculates the difference between the
Empirical Probability and Theoretical Probability
